I find myself not even able to think of anything clever to title this review ( assuming I am ever clever in the first place ) .I had high hopes for this novel as it dealt with the long-hidden tomb of Alexander The Great , and the discovery that there may be a treasure trove of ancient artifacts buried with him up for grabs.Daniel Knox , the protagonist of the book , is your average , run of the mill 'hero ' for a novel of this ilk ... .he of course gets swept up in a quest to find the purported treasure , and of course the requisite bad guys and damsel in distress that he 'seemingly ca n't resist ' make appearances throughout the book.What does n't make an appearance , to me , is a plot that shows anything more than the most basic of research into the life and death of one of the greatest warriors in history ... a man who changed the face of Greece and Macedonia in his efforts to conquer the world.For a book to just kill time with , this will certainly do the trick .####[['book', 'neutral']]
Also , a great way to learn about all the different dinosaurs .####[['way', 'positive']]

So it 's lucky there 's a new member of the team - Hanna , an experienced and efficient officer has transferred to the district - especially since more deaths are on the way ...

Next to my adored Abraham Verghese , MD , Dr. M. is the best medical/MD writing today.If you have any interest in cancer/oncology , you MUST read this book .####[['book', 'positive']]

The editors just thought that no one would notice or care , but I at least did and it bothered the hell out of me until I could figure it out.This isn't the only case of sloppy or lazy editing , as this book has probably the most amount of spell-check errors I 've ever seen in a published book .####[['editing', 'negative'], ['editors', 'negative'], ['spell-check errors', 'negative']]

Plenty to keep Patrik and his team occupied with few leads and plenty of questions.This is the fourth novel published by the author in the United States , and each has been consistently high quality , well-plotted , carefully translated and well written Perhaps most importantly , the characters are natural , every-day type of people , living typical lives and working hard .####[['characters', 'positive'], ['fourth novel', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]

I would have also liked to have seen more of what Jonna will do next , but I was pleased that based on the ending , there is a chance one of the young men could be seen in future books.The Stranger was a bit more predictable than other books in the series , but also thankfully , less gory .####[['books.The Stranger', 'negative']]

Perhaps it is because I have n't read one of these action-packed , Hollywood-style thrillers in a while , but Will Adams 's The Alexander Cipher hit the nail on the head with its action , mystery , historical intrigue and entertaining characters.I 've always had a love of Alexandrian history and this has it aplenty .####[['Alexandrian history', 'positive'], ['characters.I', 'positive'], ["Will Adams 's The Alexander Cipher", 'positive']]

That being said , I found this book to be very entertaining .####[['book', 'positive']]
I 'm also curious if they 'll ever release all the books as a box set , or maybe as a digital set on the Kindle ... ? The only part which didn't make much sense to me ( and seemed like a huge waste of time , or perhaps a page filler ) was the journey of Hal , Ty , Stephane and Gabriella.Anyway , if you 're a fan of Feist , get this book as I doubt you 'll be disappointed - the paperback version that I got seems to be free of the errors that plagued the hardcover .####[['book', 'negative']]

Each of the characters in the story were well thought out and gave their own bit of personality to the complete story.The author had several different stories going on at once and I was n't sure how they were all going to be connected at first , but the author did tie everything together gradually through the book so you were n't left out in the field wondering which path was going to lead you to the chocolate prize at the end.Even though this was book 4 in the Fjllbacka stories , I felt that you could read this as a stand-alone without having read the other three .####[['characters', 'positive']]

I recommend the series not because you will smile while reading it , but because -- if you are are a fan of human complexity -- reading it will annoy you like a deep muscle massage given by Angry Helga , and then leave you feeling kind of floaty and satisfied afterwards.At this point , I will read anything by Hobb , no matter what .####[['series', 'positive']]

Although that signals the end of a wonderful story line , the story itself has gotten more complex over time .####[['story', 'negative'], ['story line', 'positive']]
I would have to say that the story was definitely interesting .####[['story', 'positive']]
I 've been reading Faye Kellerman 's books for at least 7 years and The Burnt House is her best yet .####[['The Burnt House', 'positive']]
very very satisfied with their service and look for them in the future for other purchases .####[['them', 'positive'], ['service', 'positive']]
And what should have been a clever plot device with Soldier 's Son and Nevare just wound up being clumsy and annoying to read , and really not that interesting .####[['plot', 'neutral']]
I 'm a HUGE fan of Faye Kellerman 's husband , Jonathan Kellerman but have n't been able to get into her novels.My biggest problem with Burnt House is the fact that Decker does n't believe in coincidences .####[['Burnt House', 'negative']]
Everything is concluded in a satisfying way which I always prefer to the downright incomplete endings that some authors throw in .####[['endings', 'positive'], ['way', 'positive']]
The main characters are realistic and she does a good job with dialog .####[['job', 'positive']]
As a voracious reader of many genres who experiences books in a visceral manner , and as a woman who was physically incapable of bearing children , I knew this story would be painful and tried to avoid it .####[['story', 'positive']]
The author of this excellent book thinks in monarchic terms .####[['book', 'positive']]
Celeste Jones ' book is a no-holds-barred riveting story that starts out in high gear and gets right into the story - a true story - of growing up in a cult with a very peculiar set of life philosophies .####[["Celeste Jones ' book", 'positive'], ['life philosophies', 'neutral']]
If you love mysteries you 'll love this one .####[['this one', 'positive']]
Really wonderfully research and written.As a person with cancer my opinion is that this book is a must read .####[['book', 'positive']]
For me , with this last book , it just really sours the whole seris .####[['last book', 'negative']]
All in all , an exciting tale with a big surprise ending .####[['ending', 'positive'], ['tale', 'positive']]
I ca n't put the book down .####[['book', 'positive']]
Even though I did n't love the trilogy there are moments that must be experienced by any fanstasy lover .####[['trilogy', 'negative']]
I loved the way the author built up the mystery and kept adding to it so you got a nice rounded story .####[['story', 'positive'], ['author', 'positive'], ['way', 'positive']]
I 'm delighted that this book is finally in print as I 've had it on my wish list for the past three years after I 'd read that Ms. Lamb would be publishing another book about Afghanistan .####[['book', 'positive']]
I 've never been overly found of most of the characters other than Pug and Thomas ( and perhaps Macros and Nakor ) but those two individuals more than make up for the rest for me even though we saw little of Thomas this time around .####[['those two individuals', 'positive']]
A story that grabbed this reader and wo n't let go .####[['story', 'positive']]
Was hoping to read more from this author but when I went to see what to read next by Cathy Glass , all of her books are out of my fixed income .####[['Cathy Glass', 'positive'], ['books', 'positive']]
Although the main protagonists appear in her other novels , it is not necessary to read them to enjoy this book .####[['main protagonists', 'neutral']]
I felt close to Nevare but not to Soldier 's Boy .####[['Nevare', 'positive'], ["Soldier 's Boy", 'negative']]
It was a very interesting book , but I think it could have been written in a different way .####[['book', 'positive']]
As a sexual assault forensic nurse it still was a rude awakening but very well written.Thank you .####[['sexual assault forensic nurse', 'negative']]
It 's just too bad most of the book feels like Navarre and Soldier 's Boy pounding their heads against the wall until suddenly everything becomes clear.Renegade 's Magic , and consequently the rest of the Soldier 's Son series , isn't for everybody .####[['book', 'negative'], ['most of the', 'negative']]
I HAVE CANCER AND I LEARNED A LOT FROM THIS BOOK####[['BOOK', 'positive']]
This book opens one 's eyes to the things that can happen to children-by mistake .####[['book', 'positive']]
The author does an excellent job presenting both the science and the art of cancer research as well as its impact on patient care and treatment .####[['job', 'positive']]
This is a great storyline to follow .####[['storyline', 'positive']]
however i like Paul Burrell attitude in how he wrote this book compared to his first one Royal Duty-which i also purchase.. he seems to acknowledge others people viewpoints while being humble by his experience at the trial .####[['Paul Burrell', 'positive']]
A great introduction and overview of the complexity of the disease wecall cancer .####[['overview', 'positive'], ['introduction', 'positive']]
The third book in the series , The Stonecutter once again re-introduced main character Patrik 's fiancee into the main plotline , but she again fades to the background in this , the fourth episode.What I loved most about the first book in the series The Ice Princess was Erika 's involvement , as she was friends with the victim .####[["Erika 's involvement", 'positive']]
The story of cancer has its heroes and its villiains , but Mukherjee tells the story with clarity and intelligence .####[['story', 'positive']]
This is a good book to read if you work with emotionally disturbed children , and what classroom does n't have at least one .####[['book', 'positive']]
Lackberg 's characterisation ( even of minor characters ) is spot-on , and her plot sufficiently convoluted to keep the reader guessing to ( almost ) the last page .####[['plot', 'positive'], ["Lackberg 's characterisation", 'positive']]
I truly wanted to see how this series would end.Unfortunately this book was a massive disappointment to me .####[['book', 'negative']]
Came as promised - perfect shape !####[['shape', 'positive']]
Awesome book so clearly written and so informative on our journeys with cancer .####[['book', 'positive']]
The happily ever after ending is also a little contrived .####[['ending', 'negative']]
I greatly enjoyed the first two books ( Shaman 's Crossing and Forest Mage ) , but as the pace remained glacial , my love for the series waned a bit .####[["Shaman 's Crossing and Forest Mage", 'positive'], ['pace', 'negative']]
Unfortunately , because of this book , I have not rushed to order the next in the series like I had done after reading the prior ones .####[['book', 'negative']]
I love the characters Patrick and Erica .####[['Patrick and Erica', 'positive']]
That doesn't take away that this book seems to be comprehensive as we meet hundreds of people involved in the fight against cancer .####[['book', 'neutral']]
His writing is astounding .####[['writing', 'positive']]
However , I certainly did enjoy watching Hedstr & ouml ; m and his team conduct their investigations into the two deaths , finding clues and piecing them together in this strongest book of the series so far.If you like to learn a bit about another country , be a part of intricate investigations , and immerse yourself in the lives of fictional characters , then I certainly recommend crime fiction written by Camilla L & auml ; ckberg .####[['Camilla L & auml ; ckberg', 'positive'], ['crime fiction', 'positive'], ['book', 'positive']]
As a cancer survivor I found the book extremely detailed yet interesting .####[['book', 'positive']]
A must read and rent .####[['rent', 'positive'], ['read', 'positive']]
She has a limited number of characters , but they 're all very well created .####[['characters', 'positive']]
I love this series !####[['series', 'positive']]
The characters are interesting as always in a Lckberg novel , and this time especially Gsta , an elderly , usually unambitious , detective .####[['Gsta', 'positive'], ['characters', 'positive']]
This book was outstanding , and one that should be read with care for anyone working in oncology .####[['book', 'positive']]
Book could have been shorter -- too many forgettable names , but unforgettable experiences .####[['experiences', 'positive'], ['Book', 'neutral'], ['names', 'negative']]
Were lucky she lived to tell the tale and lucky too she tells it so well .####[['tale', 'positive']]
The woman 's a legend .####[['woman', 'positive']]

Thus although you will never know it , you will have been there at the initial motivation of that person and thus indirectly present at the earliest genesis of the eventual great idea.This book has THAT potential .####[['book', 'positive']]
Dr. Mukherjee takes us on a long and twisted journey to discover the essential underpinnings of an illusive foe .####[['journey', 'positive']]
I will simply say that I fell in love with Mr Feist 's books when I read Magician 's Apprentice so many years ago .####[["Mr Feist 's books", 'positive']]
Her books are extremely well-written .####[['books', 'positive']]
I enjoyed this mystery totally as I enjoy all of her books####[['books', 'positive'], ['mystery', 'positive']]
And given the amount of death that must be seen in this field , it must be hard to keep that humanity without becoming cynical.I 'm keeping this book ... and will probably read it again .####[['book', 'positive']]
The editors later noticed the problem , but were too lazy to actually fix it as it wouldn't just be a name switch ; the character in chapter 4 WAS Pug , not Magnus with the wrong name .####[['editors', 'negative']]
Sometimes the delivery of the chemical terms are quite humerous !####[['delivery', 'positive']]
Two stars is a generous rating for this book - The Burnt House was a real disappointment .####[['The Burnt House', 'negative'], ['book', 'negative']]
Along the way , you 'll pick up some unexpected twists that also make for good mystery reading.This plot relies on a lot of coincidences .####[['twists', 'positive']]
There is absolutely no suspense here and the hero is a flake .####[['hero', 'negative']]
Interesting characters as well as good plot .####[['characters', 'positive'], ['plot', 'positive']]
I liked this story .####[['story', 'positive']]
Every character has something about them that 's dislikeable and some parts that are great .####[['character', 'positive']]
Loved this book , because the author worked closely with her daily .####[['book', 'positive']]
She manages to keep her characters true , book after book .####[['characters', 'positive']]
The only compliment I can pay you is that your son is such an excellent writer that he puts you to shame .####[['your son', 'positive']]
Who would guess that a book about cancer can be so good ... ? Only minus was maybe that the timeline is not constant but jumps a lot back and forth.Otherwise a brilliant book !####[['timeline', 'negative'], ['book', 'positive']]
Dialogue started to bother me here as well , as it has little in common with the way real people talk .####[['Dialogue', 'negative']]
I still enjoyed the book ; both cases held my interest and I liked reading about the wedding plans Erica was making with the help of her sister Anna .####[['book', 'positive'], ['both cases', 'positive']]
Yes a true story of an amazing woman with enough love to fill this land .####[['woman', 'positive']]
Just a great book , read it .####[['book', 'positive']]
I bought his other Knox thriller and enjoyed it , as well .####[['other Knox thriller', 'positive']]
There are some great scenes between Erica and her sister , but not enough with her and her best friend Dan or between her and Patrik , but Erica is too strong of a character to be a mere subplot .####[['scenes', 'positive']]
All of these Decker-Lazrus books are fantastic .####[['Decker-Lazrus books', 'positive']]

Great narration ( I like Vance 's pronunciation of surnames in the Swedish manner ) .####[['narration', 'positive']]
I wo n't spoil them here , other than to say there is a scene with dragons taking flight that has me grinning with excitement , and a world-ending cliffhanger that had my jaw dropping to the floor .####[['world-ending cliffhanger', 'positive']]
Discontinuities of rather epic proportions emerge .####[['Discontinuities', 'negative']]
Absolutely the best book on the area and what went right and what went wrong .####[['book', 'positive']]
Not an easy subject to write about , much less hold the reader 's attention .####[['subject', 'negative']]
Aside from the passive voice , which is always annoying , that word housed is irksome .####[['passive voice', 'negative'], ['word', 'negative']]
Great book , really sets up the bid ending of book three####[['book', 'positive']]
Damaged is the type of book that sucks you in right from the start and makes you keep reading even when the subject matter starts to get painful .####[['Damaged', 'positive'], ['subject', 'negative']]
Interesting characters .####[['characters', 'positive']]
But the premise of the book SEEMED to be the aspects involving the mistreatment of the women/girls in the faith more than anything .####[['premise', 'negative']]
A great read for newcomers to the world of oncology or just the generally curious .####[['read', 'positive']]
Great adventure/history read .####[['adventure/history read', 'positive']]
The story line seemed to try a bit too hard to be trendy with the reality TV scenario .####[['story line', 'negative']]
The book was so full of information that I did not know regarding the history , research and treatment of cancer .####[['book', 'positive']]
Mukherjee has spun out followups , TEDx talks , and a three part PBS film by documentary master Ken Burns that I am enjoying now.Mukherjee 's articulate writing , his command of a phrase , his innate ability to weave a story are brilliant .####[['story', 'positive']]
Looking forward to more reads from same authors####[['authors', 'positive'], ['reads', 'positive']]
Nevare has been driving me nuts this whole trilogy , just as FitzChivalry Farseer did before him , but it matters little ; I 'll keep coming back to Robin Hobb because she can write up a storm .####[['Robin Hobb', 'positive']]
A fascinating and well written history of cancer in all of its forms .####[['history', 'positive']]
A bit difficult in the beginning to follow the parallel stories butgot better worth finishing .####[['stories', 'positive']]
My main complaint : it is an extremely boring read .####[['read', 'negative']]
Tedious and contrived with too many subplots .####[['subplots', 'negative']]
I found The Stranger a very satisfying read , so much so that I 've ordered four more books by Camilla Lackberg .####[['The Stranger', 'positive']]
A good mystery - hard to go so far back to find connections and began to seemdisjointed , but it all came together very well .####[['mystery', 'positive']]
Sadly , the resolution of this second plot will hinge on an incredible coincidence that Kellerman does n't really even try to justify.This coincidence hurts The Burnt House , but not irreparably ; overall , this remains a good book .####[['The Burnt House', 'neutral'], ['book', 'positive'], ['plot', 'negative']]
I love the way she flips from present to past and back again .####[['way', 'positive']]

Another excellent read which loses nothing in translation####[['translation', 'positive'], ['read', 'positive']]
Such a great book .####[['book', 'positive']]
I did not like this book as much as the previous ones in the series by this author .####[['book', 'negative'], ['previous ones', 'negative']]
I could n't believe I would understand this book , but I did , painful but interesting .####[['book', 'negative']]
The plot was ridiculous , the coincidence unbelievable .####[['plot', 'negative']]
Also , it seems to be written in such a way as to appeal to those who are looking for titillating scenarios of older men forcing young girls ( think ten years old and younger ) into extremely sexual situations .####[['way', 'negative']]
The first 150 pages or so are the best .####[['first 150 pages', 'positive']]
I have read many Diana books but this one was great because it zoomed in on so many happenings in her life that no other books about her have revealed .####[['this one', 'positive']]

A great read that brought a tear to my eye and a few angry moments too !####[['read', 'positive']]
But the fundamental premise is fun , and the rapid-fire finish is a wild ride , with the author finally stepping outside of being trite and concluding with an odd partnership to round up the bad guys .####[['author', 'positive']]

They were a little too large , but the next size smaller would have been too short .####[['They', 'negative']]

This is just a good , cute shoe that goes to almost any occasion without shame and will keep your feet cool and rested -- unless you go mountain hiking in them , that would make a difference .####[['shoe', 'positive']]
I have much better luck with tights , but needed something that could serve the purpose of pantyhose on my closet .####[['tights', 'positive']]
Great tights ; these were exactly what I was looking for to go along with a costume dress and knee-high boots .####[['tights', 'positive']]
I can not believe the quality of this shirt for under $ 10 .####[['quality', 'positive']]

Heavy shimmery stockings that are nice for winter .####[['stockings', 'positive']]
Even if you had calves like Schwarzenegger they would be too big .####[['they', 'negative']]
I bought them mainly because I have nerve damage , as well as severe arthritis in my legs , and I have talked to countless Hooters girls who have all sworn by them because the ones that have gotten in the past are simply too expensive , but these danskins are of the same quality , and hold up , and keep the gloss alive for a long time as well as the one other important reason to wear them is support which is my reason for wearing them .####[['the ones', 'negative'], ['danskins', 'positive']]
Excellent shipping and quality .####[['shipping', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]

The black shoes have a soft bed from a fabric that feels almost like fleece and my feet sweat quickly in it.BALANCE : One issue that I have with all four pairs of Capezio shoes that I ordered ( will return 3 ) is that the heel seems to be at a slightly different angle than the front part of the shoe .####[['bed', 'positive'], ['heel', 'negative'], ['all four pairs of Capezio shoes', 'negative'], ['fabric', 'negative']]

I bought classic light toast , I 'll be ordering a second pair in just light toast to better fit my skin tone ( super pale ) and they run a little small in the hips , so getting a size up in my opinion is a good idea .####[['they', 'negative']]

My 13 year old daughter was delighted with these tights - usually she ca n't wait to get her ballet tights off as soon as her class ends but these were so comfortable I think she forgot she had them on ... .####[['tights', 'positive']]
This shirt will bleed color onto your other clothing items , so do n't let it get wet around white/light colored items.My biggest complaint with this shirt is that the listing , when I purchased it , did not specify that the sleeve length when fully extended was only 3/4th sleeves .####[['sleeve', 'negative']]
They are okay but not comfortable for a lot of walking .####[['They', 'neutral']]
% xl was at best 3xl on the small side..####[['xl', 'positive'], ['3xl', 'negative']]

When the right size is purchased they fit fantastic , very comfortable and make it do much easier to dance .####[['they', 'positive']]

These are n't sparkly , they 're shimmery , which makes my legs look amazing .####[['they', 'positive']]

The moc itself fits fine ( the leather is soft enough to stretch ) but the sole is so narrow it 's way too uncomfortable to wear .####[['moc', 'negative'], ['leather', 'positive'], ['sole', 'negative']]
As long as I won't have any flash photos taken of me , or be under any stage lights , they will not be overwhelming.While these are about three times the cost of most pantyhose you 'd buy at the supermarket , it is certainly a good investment for a sturdy pair of good quality , USA-made tights .####[['quality', 'positive'], ['tights', 'positive']]
Love this shoe .####[['shoe', 'neutral']]
The size said can all but I got a size large or bigger .####[['size', 'negative']]
Plus they are very durable .####[['they', 'positive']]

The best tights .####[['tights', 'positive']]
The only problem , ( which other people have mentioned ) , is that they do tend to run narrow , so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe , I think that they are a great value.Addendum : I now have three pairs of these shoes , in different colors .####[['they', 'negative'], ['shoe', 'negative']]
I returned them .####[['them', 'negative']]

Width wise it 's perfect .####[['Width', 'positive']]
The price is good too .####[['price', 'positive']]
The sole has a little cushion that makes it extra comfy for walking.Definitely feel like these shoes were a great value.FWIW , my feet got used to the shoes fast , though I did get a small blister on one foot the first day where the back of the strap is ( this is common for my feet ) .####[['shoes', 'positive']]
I still like the double deerskin sole better for comfort but it 's nice to have the rubber soles for wearing outdoors and no leather ties to have to mess with .####[['rubber soles', 'positive'], ['double deerskin sole', 'positive']]
They are still really cute and will be great for slacks , jeans , shorts , skirts , even a nice dress .####[['They', 'positive']]
My waist is around 31-32 and the size B were a perfect fit .####[['size B', 'positive']]

I actually purchased the crinoline before the dress and jacket I planned to wear were made.Unfortunately , the dress did not fit as I had hoped but after some rethinking , the dress became a skirt and with the right accessories -- THE CRINOLINE BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE -- I had the 1950 's outfit I wanted.The crinoline really brought back such comforting memories of my childhood , when ladies actually dressed up to go out and the poofier your skirt was the better it looked.I love this crinoline and I 'm trying to think of ways to incorporate it into my daily wardrobe and not just wear it for special occasions .####[['crinoline', 'positive'], ['dress', 'negative']]

Not the best quality leather , but they are pretty well made , so they will last through a dance season if you are taking a class , and probably much longer depending on use.The Size Question amazon asked stated too small as the only option that made sense , but the aren't really too small - you just have to know that dance shoes are always at least a size smaller than street shoes - sometimes even two sizes .####[['they', 'positive']]

you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck####[['headphones', 'negative']]
compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .####[['value', 'positive']]
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .####[['player', 'positive']]
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .####[['macro', 'positive'], ['auto mode', 'positive']]
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .####[['mediasource organizer', 'positive']]
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .####[['dvd player', 'positive'], ['design', 'positive'], ['works', 'positive']]
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####[['machines', 'positive'], ['quality', 'negative']]
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .####[['mediasource software', 'negative']]
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .####[['buttons', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['navigate', 'positive']]
on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !####[['headphones', 'negative'], ['sound quality', 'positive']]
great colors , pictures and white balance .####[['white balance', 'positive']]
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .####[['speakerphone', 'positive'], ['currency converter', 'positive'], ['stopwatch', 'positive']]
sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .####[['sound', 'positive']]
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .####[['progressive scan option', 'positive'], ['remote control', 'positive']]
i just bought this player today and i already love it .####[['player', 'positive']]
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .####[['3x optical zoom', 'negative']]
either way , can 't go wrong with this price .####[['price', 'positive']]
door broke after a month .####[['door', 'negative']]
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .####[['firmware', 'negative'], ['os', 'negative']]
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !####[['camera', 'positive']]
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .####[['panel', 'negative']]
the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .####[['music', 'positive']]
the camera has a wonderful set of features .####[['set', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
some dvd 's i rented would not play .####[['dvd', 'negative'], ['play', 'negative']]
for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .####[['price', 'positive'], ['size', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .####[['controls', 'positive'], ['manual', 'positive']]
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .####[['continuous shot mode', 'positive']]
it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .####[['design', 'positive']]
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .####[['speed', 'negative']]
the volume level of the phone is not all that good .####[['volume level', 'negative']]
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .####[['setup', 'positive'], ['fiddling', 'positive']]
the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .####[['scroll wheel', 'negative']]
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .####[['memory', 'positive']]
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .####[['high resolution screen', 'positive'], ['read', 'positive'], ['backlight', 'positive']]
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .####[['battery', 'positive'], ['software', 'positive'], ['casing', 'positive']]
the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .####[['mp3 player', 'positive'], ['software', 'negative']]
the software sucks .####[['software', 'negative']]
for the price it is a well spent investment !####[['price', 'positive']]
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .####[['case', 'positive']]
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !####[['quality', 'positive'], ['pictures', 'positive']]
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .####[['pics', 'negative'], ['camera', 'positive']]
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .####[['zx', 'positive']]
then sorting the files is easy as pie .####[['sorting', 'positive'], ['files', 'positive']]
and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?####[['price', 'positive']]
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####[['size', 'positive'], ['durability', 'negative']]
you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .####[['rip', 'positive']]
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display####[['screen', 'negative'], ['read', 'negative']]
other than that this thing is great ...####[['thing', 'positive']]
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )####[['size', 'positive']]
you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .####[['song', 'positive']]
apex sucks !####[['apex', 'negative']]
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .####[['use', 'positive']]
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .####[['viewfinder', 'negative']]
great screen and great sound .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive']]
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .####[['g3 raw image software', 'negative']]
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .####[['photo quality', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .####[['player user interface', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['navigation', 'positive']]
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .####[['headphone jack failure', 'negative']]
for the price and features it is really good .####[['price', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####[['remote', 'negative']]
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .####[['menus', 'negative'], ['functions', 'negative']]
video output stopped workin .####[['video output', 'negative']]
the sound quality is very good .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
otherwise , this player is awesome !####[['player', 'positive']]
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .####[['menu options', 'negative']]
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .####[['mp3 player', 'positive']]
made the camera totally inoperable .####[['camera', 'negative']]
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .####[['download', 'positive']]
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !####[['camera', 'positive']]
but , i would definately recommend this phone .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .####[['hear', 'positive']]
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .####[['learn', 'positive']]
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .####[['sound quality', 'negative']]
in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .####[['artist', 'positive'], ['album', 'positive'], ['folders', 'negative']]
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .####[['affordability', 'positive']]
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .####[['use', 'positive']]
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .####[['reception', 'negative']]
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .####[['use', 'positive']]
- well-backlit keypad####[['keypad', 'positive']]
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .####[['battery', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive']]
it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .####[['play', 'positive'], ['dvd-r', 'positive']]
i am really impressed by this dvd player .####[['dvd player', 'positive']]
battery life is ok .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
i forgot , the case does n't fit .####[['case', 'negative']]
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .####[['apex', 'positive'], ['quality brand', 'positive']]
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .####[['30gb zen xtra', 'positive']]
the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .####[['instructions', 'negative']]
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )####[['4mp', 'positive']]
great feature list , poor reliability .####[['feature list', 'positive'], ['reliability', 'negative']]
the buttons and interface are very easy to use .####[['buttons', 'positive'], ['interface', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .####[['running', 'positive'], ['dvds', 'positive']]
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .####[['dynamic playlists', 'negative'], ['menus', 'negative'], ['get', 'negative'], ['operate', 'negative']]
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####[['key arrangement', 'negative'], ['shapes', 'negative']]
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !####[['camera', 'positive']]
creative software stinks .####[['software', 'negative']]
10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .####[['play modes', 'positive']]
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .####[['name', 'negative']]
but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .####[['zen manual', 'negative']]
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['images', 'positive']]
do n't buy this player .####[['player', 'negative']]
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .####[['transfer cable', 'negative']]
forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.####[['looks', 'negative'], ['play', 'negative']]
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .####[['speakerphone', 'positive'], ['radio', 'positive']]
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !####[['finish', 'positive']]
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .####[['instructions', 'negative']]
overall , a good buy for the price .####[['price', 'positive']]
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .####[['t-zones', 'negative']]
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['carry', 'positive']]
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .####[['shoe', 'positive']]
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .####[['price-wise zens', 'positive']]
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####[['sound', 'positive']]
it was no problem for me to use their software .####[['software', 'positive']]
will never purchase apex again .####[['apex', 'negative']]
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .####[['software', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .####[['battery life', 'negative']]
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .####[['memory', 'positive']]
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .####[['earbuds', 'positive']]
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.####[['closeup mode', 'positive'], ['rechargable battery', 'positive']]
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .####[['mechanics', 'negative']]
silverish color really adds a special touch .####[['silverish color', 'positive']]
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .####[['battery charging system', 'positive']]
connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !####[['player', 'positive']]
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .####[['build quality', 'negative'], ['face plate', 'negative']]
the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['voice dialing', 'negative']]
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .####[['sound level', 'negative']]
that 's a rare and valuable feature .####[['feature', 'positive']]
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .####[['memory', 'positive']]
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .####[['mediasource', 'positive'], ['load', 'positive']]
- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking####[['voice activated dialing', 'negative']]
it also has unproven battery life .####[['battery life', 'negative']]
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .####[['range', 'positive'], ['formats', 'positive']]
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .####[['raw format', 'positive'], ['post-processing flexibility', 'positive']]
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .####[['mms technology', 'positive']]
very bad quality .####[['quality', 'negative']]
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .####[['product support', 'negative']]
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .####[['scroll button', 'negative']]
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .####[['operating system', 'negative']]
3 ) user replaceable battery####[['battery', 'positive']]
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .####[['lip-sync issue', 'negative']]
this thing seriously is a good player though .####[['player', 'positive']]
one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .####[['scroll', 'negative']]
the battery recharges real fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .####[['battery recharges', 'positive']]
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .####[['product', 'positive']]
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .####[['id3 tags', 'negative']]
the phone is small , light , and very attractive .####[['phone', 'positive']]
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .####[['mp3 player', 'positive']]
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####[['face-plate', 'negative']]
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .####[['stitch pictures feature', 'positive']]
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .####[['leather pouch', 'positive']]
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .####[['autofocus', 'negative']]
* slick-looking design and improved interface####[['design', 'positive'], ['interface', 'positive']]
one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !####[['screen', 'negative']]
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .####[['data storage device', 'negative']]
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .####[['remote', 'negative']]
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .####[['eax', 'positive']]
6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .####[['recharge', 'negative'], ['usb recharging', 'negative']]
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .####[['dvds', 'negative'], ['play', 'negative']]
one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .####[['remote control', 'negative']]
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .####[['picture quality', 'positive'], ['outdoor settings', 'positive']]
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['light', 'positive'], ['music transfer', 'positive'], ['controls', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive'], ['equilizer', 'positive']]
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .####[['voice dialing', 'negative']]
only con i can think of is no camera ... .####[['camera', 'negative']]
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .####[['nomad jukebox', 'positive']]
on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .####[['sound', 'positive']]
player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .####[['player works', 'positive'], ['looks', 'positive']]
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .####[['radio', 'positive']]
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .####[['manage', 'positive'], ['change', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive']]
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .####[['non-slr digital camera', 'positive']]
the price / performance looked just right .####[['price', 'positive'], ['performance', 'positive']]
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )####[['environmental audio', 'negative'], ['sound', 'negative']]
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .####[['4300', 'positive'], ['nikon', 'positive']]
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .####[['read', 'negative']]
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .####[['access', 'negative'], ['menus', 'negative'], ['dvds', 'negative']]
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .####[['mp3 players', 'positive'], ['sound quality', 'positive']]
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####[['sound', 'positive'], ['power output', 'positive']]
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .####[['40gb nomad zen xtra', 'positive']]
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .####[['shots', 'negative']]
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .####[['body construction', 'negative']]
usb 2.0 - very fast####[['usb 2.0', 'positive']]
the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .####[['build quality', 'positive'], ['playing discs', 'positive'], ['picture', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive']]
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "####[['freezing', 'negative']]
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .####[['buttons', 'negative']]
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .####[['delete', 'positive']]
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .####[['phone', 'positive']]
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .####[['change genre', 'negative'], ['album', 'negative'], ['track information', 'negative']]
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .####[['software', 'positive'], ['mp3 player', 'positive']]
after two weeks the picture kept freezing .####[['picture', 'negative']]
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .####[['rate plans', 'positive']]
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !####[['apex dvd player', 'positive']]
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .####[['pop-off face', 'negative']]
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .####[['player', 'positive']]
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .####[['picture quality', 'positive'], ['durability', 'positive']]
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .####[['spare battery', 'negative']]
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .####[['navigation', 'positive'], ['syncing files', 'positive']]
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .####[['calendar', 'positive']]
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .####[['t-mobile', 'negative']]
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .####[['player', 'negative']]
there was neither picture nor sound .####[['picture', 'negative'], ['sound', 'negative']]
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .####[['product', 'positive']]
the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .####[['remote', 'negative'], ['buttons', 'negative']]
* main dial is not backlit .####[['dial', 'negative']]
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !####[['nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb', 'positive']]
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .####[['highest optical zoom pictures', 'positive']]
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .####[['camera', 'positive']]
the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .####[['cut-outs', 'negative'], ['controls', 'negative']]
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .####[['sound settings', 'positive']]
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .####[['movie clips', 'negative']]
unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .####[['unit', 'negative'], ['recognize', 'negative'], ['play', 'negative']]
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .####[['focusing system', 'positive']]
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####[['hard drive', 'negative']]
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .####[['size', 'positive']]
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .####[['front cover', 'negative'], ['feels', 'negative']]
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .####[['online print ordering', 'positive']]
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .####[['software', 'positive'], ['filing system', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .####[['indoor setting', 'negative']]
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .####[['earpiece', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .####[['price', 'positive']]
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .####[['bookmarks', 'negative']]
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .####[['making playlists', 'negative']]
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .####[['speaker phone', 'positive'], ['radio', 'positive'], ['infrared', 'positive']]
it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .####[['video formats', 'positive']]
2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !####[['i/p button', 'positive']]
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .####[['speaker phone', 'positive']]
seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " .####[['dvds', 'negative'], ['music cds', 'negative'], ['loading', 'negative'], ['no disc', 'negative']]
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !####[['resolution digital camera', 'positive']]
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .####[['sounds', 'positive'], ['line out jack', 'negative']]
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .####[['eax mode', 'positive']]
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .####[['power button', 'negative'], ['external display', 'negative'], ['read', 'negative']]
the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .####[['scroll button', 'positive']]
great phone .. .####[['phone', 'positive']]
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .####[['tunes', 'positive']]
this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .####[['dvd player', 'positive']]
audio is excellent .####[['audio', 'positive']]
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .####[['size', 'positive']]
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .####[['setup process', 'negative'], ['interface', 'negative']]
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .####[['organizer software', 'positive']]
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).####[['transfer songs', 'negative']]
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .####[['size', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
for the money apex machines have good features .####[['features', 'positive']]
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .####[['volume range', 'positive']]
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .####[['entertaining games', 'negative']]
definetely a great camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]
( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )####[['apex dvd players', 'positive']]

recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .####[['g3', 'positive']]
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .####[['signal quality', 'positive'], ['signal', 'positive'], ['reception', 'positive']]
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .####[['control', 'positive'], ['mode', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .####[['sound', 'positive']]
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .####[['dvd', 'negative'], ['freeze', 'negative']]

my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .####[['tagging process', 'negative'], ['interacts', 'negative']]
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .####[['phone', 'positive']]
this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .####[['appearance', 'positive']]

so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .####[['player', 'positive']]
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .####[['extended zoom range', 'positive'], ['faster lense', 'positive']]
granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .####[['dvd player', 'negative']]
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .####[['transfers', 'positive']]
this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !####[['phone', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['ergonomics', 'positive']]

i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .####[['volume level', 'negative']]
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .####[['reception', 'positive'], ['customization', 'positive'], ['applications', 'positive']]
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .####[['playlists', 'negative']]
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .####[['use', 'positive'], ['laid out', 'positive']]
i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !####[['sounds', 'positive'], ['picture clarity', 'negative']]
can 't say whether i rec 'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .####[['read dvd', 'negative'], ['vcd', 'negative']]
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .####[['sync', 'positive']]
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['options', 'positive'], ['power', 'positive']]

the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .####[['picture', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive']]
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .####[['case', 'positive']]
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .####[['product', 'negative']]
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .####[['use', 'positive']]
when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .####[['motor', 'negative'], ['eject', 'negative']]
learning how to use it will not take very long .####[['learning', 'positive']]
i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .####[['software', 'positive'], ['defaults genres', 'positive']]
battery life is good for a phone of this size .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .####[['looking', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive']]

the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .####[['color screen', 'positive'], ['ringtones', 'positive']]
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .####[['focusing', 'negative'], ['low light', 'negative']]
first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most aesthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .####[['looking player', 'negative']]
this camera has a major design flaw .####[['design', 'negative']]
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .####[['cd burner', 'negative']]
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .####[['customer service dept', 'negative']]
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .####[['player', 'positive']]
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !####[['at&t customer service', 'negative']]
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !####[['battery', 'negative']]
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .####[['replaceable battery', 'positive']]
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .####[['lens', 'positive'], ['picture quality', 'positive']]
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .####[['dvds', 'positive'], ['play', 'positive']]
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .####[['navigation', 'positive']]
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .####[['photo quality', 'positive']]

this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['manipulate', 'positive'], ['scroll', 'positive']]

i love this player .####[['player', 'positive']]
it will read and play all cd audio disc .####[['read', 'positive'], ['cd audio disc', 'positive']]

if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .####[['software', 'positive'], ['access', 'positive']]
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .####[['looks', 'positive']]
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .####[['radio', 'positive'], ['reception', 'positive']]
the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .####[['size', 'positive'], ['design', 'positive'], ['imo looking', 'positive']]
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .####[['qualities', 'positive'], ['picture', 'positive']]
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .####[['design', 'positive'], ['construction', 'positive']]

i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .####[['installing', 'negative']]
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
also , the instruction manual is very bad .####[['instruction manual', 'negative']]
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .####[['viewfinder', 'negative']]
- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .####[['structured', 'positive'], ['buttons', 'positive']]
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .####[['feels', 'negative']]
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .####[['reception', 'positive'], ['sound quality', 'positive']]
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .####[['software', 'positive']]
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .####[['speakerphone', 'positive']]
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course####[['look', 'negative']]
but with a low price , comes lower quality .####[['price', 'positive'], ['quality', 'negative']]
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .####[['construction', 'negative']]
i will never buy a creative product again .####[['creative product', 'negative']]
* removable battery####[['battery', 'positive']]
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####[['depth', 'positive'], ['field', 'positive']]

do n't buy this player .####[['player', 'negative']]
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .####[['video', 'negative'], ['features', 'negative']]
it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['basic features', 'positive']]
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .####[['phone', 'positive']]
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####[['download', 'negative']]
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .####[['freezes', 'negative']]
battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .####[['battery recharge', 'positive']]
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .####[['performance', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]
sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .####[['player', 'negative']]
once again , the sound is awesome , the batter life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .####[['sound', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'negative']]
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .####[['power supply', 'negative']]
* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .####[['eax equalizer', 'negative']]
2 ) scroll button / switch####[['scroll button', 'negative']]
audio on video also lacking .####[['audio', 'negative']]
the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful . ####[['sync', 'negative']]
only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .####[['accessories', 'negative']]
the door would not close .####[['door', 'negative']]
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['read', 'positive'], ['light', 'positive']]
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .####[['camera', 'positive']]
the software failed repeatedly .####[['software', 'negative']]
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .####[['control', 'negative']]
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?####[['lag', 'negative']]
since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " .####[['customer service reps', 'negative']]
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .####[['amazon', 'positive']]
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .####[['controls', 'negative'], ['use', 'negative']]
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .####[['design', 'positive'], ['color screen', 'positive'], ['resolution', 'positive']]
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .####[['find', 'negative'], ['online support', 'negative']]
progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .####[['progressive scan player', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####[['customer service', 'negative']]
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .####[['battery', 'positive']]
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .####[['auto', 'positive'], ['manual', 'positive']]
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .####[['battery', 'positive']]
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !####[['headphones', 'negative']]

unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is " player either not connected or busy . "####[['player', 'negative']]
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####[['firmware', 'positive']]
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .####[['play windows media', 'negative'], ['divx rips', 'negative']]
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .####[['silver plate', 'negative']]
the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .####[['headphone earbuds', 'positive']]
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .####[['ripping cds', 'positive']]
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .####[['screen', 'positive']]
the menus are very easy to navigate .####[['menus', 'positive'], ['navigate', 'positive']]
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .####[['zoom lens unit', 'negative']]
battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive####[['battery life', 'negative'], ['operators manual', 'negative'], ['software lockups', 'negative'], ['replacement battery', 'negative']]
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !####[['camera', 'positive']]
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .####[['sound', 'negative'], ['volume', 'negative']]
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .####[['value', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical####[['locations', 'negative'], ['buttons', 'negative']]
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .####[['battery', 'positive']]
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .####[['top', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative']]
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['see', 'positive'], ['colors', 'positive']]
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .####[['controls', 'negative'], ['use', 'negative'], ['software tagging system', 'negative']]
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['ring tones', 'positive']]
the remote is a little hard to understand .####[['remote', 'negative'], ['understand', 'negative']]
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .####[['phone', 'positive']]
overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .####[['unit', 'positive']]
it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .####[['earbuds', 'negative']]
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .####[['interface', 'positive']]
8 battery life is excellent .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .####[['servicing', 'negative']]

also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .####[['feature', 'negative']]
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .####[['cds', 'negative']]
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .####[['use', 'positive'], ['form factor', 'positive'], ['looks', 'positive']]
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .####[['formats', 'positive']]
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .####[['scroll wheel', 'negative']]
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .####[['network coverage', 'negative'], ['network', 'negative']]
the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .####[['scroll wheel', 'negative']]
the quality is superb . ####[['quality', 'positive']]
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .####[['picture', 'negative']]
for the most part this is a good dvd player .####[['dvd player', 'positive']]
we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .####[['headphone', 'negative']]
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.####[['camera', 'positive']]
unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .####[['id3 tags', 'negative']]
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !####[['plays', 'positive'], ['media', 'positive']]
ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .####[['ripping', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]

the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .####[['software', 'negative']]
remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .####[['remote', 'positive'], ['designed', 'positive']]
2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .####[['scroll button', 'negative'], ['select', 'negative']]
this is a great camera for you !####[['camera', 'positive']]
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .####[['fm radio', 'positive']]
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .####[['menus', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive'], ['manipulate', 'positive'], ['access', 'positive']]
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .####[['look', 'positive'], ['build', 'positive'], ['form', 'positive'], ['face plate', 'positive']]
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .####[['software', 'positive']]
also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .####[['software', 'negative']]
the features are really cool like the radio .####[['radio', 'positive']]
my only significant complaint is sound quality .####[['sound quality', 'negative']]
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .####[['features', 'positive']]
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .####[['lens viewfinder', 'negative'], ['lcd viewfinder', 'positive']]
only if we could get one camera in it . .####[['camera', 'negative']]
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .####[['volume', 'positive']]
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .####[['reception', 'positive']]
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .####[['case', 'negative']]
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['sound adjustments', 'positive']]
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .####[['player', 'positive']]
the volume .####[['volume', 'negative']]
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )####[['picture', 'negative']]
- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well####[['cover', 'negative'], ['fit', 'negative']]
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .####[['player', 'positive']]
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. . ####[['ringer', 'positive']]
3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .####[['case', 'negative']]
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .####[['read', 'negative'], ['dvds', 'negative'], ['screen', 'negative']]

less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "####[['screen freezes', 'negative']]
i have no complaints with this mp3 player .####[['mp3 player', 'positive']]
their customer service is very poor .####[['customer service', 'negative']]
as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .####[['portable player', 'negative'], ['feel', 'negative']]
weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .####[['feel', 'negative'], ['layout', 'negative'], ['remote control', 'negative'], ['filenames', 'negative'], ['mp3s', 'negative']]
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .####[['infrared', 'positive']]
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .####[['use', 'positive']]
well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .####[['program', 'negative']]
the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .####[['software', 'positive']]
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .####[['battery', 'positive']]
on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .####[['no disc', 'negative']]
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .####[['software', 'positive']]
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .####[['macro shots', 'positive']]
the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .####[['headphones', 'negative']]
software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .####[['software', 'negative']]
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .####[['tech support', 'negative']]
the lcd screen was very large and readable .####[['lcd screen', 'positive']]
the grain was terrible .####[['grain', 'negative']]
yes , the features are numerous .####[['features', 'positive']]
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .####[['mp3 player', 'positive']]
it also lets you remove songs from the play order .####[['remove songs', 'positive']]
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .####[['price', 'positive']]
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####[['backlight', 'negative']]
so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .####[['silent ringer option', 'negative']]
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .####[['pc-side software', 'negative']]
usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .####[['usb 2.0 transfer', 'positive']]
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .####[['remote', 'negative']]
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .####[['speakerphone', 'positive']]
no way to contact their customer service .####[['customer service', 'negative']]
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .####[['dvds', 'negative']]
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
only one disk played through to completion successfully .####[['disk', 'negative']]
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .####[['speakerphone', 'negative']]
i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .####[['editing', 'positive']]
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .####[['picture quality', 'positive']]
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .####[['software', 'negative'], ['case', 'negative']]
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .####[['range', 'positive'], ['manual options', 'positive']]
but the earbuds suck !####[['earbuds', 'negative']]
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .####[['use', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .####[['volume key', 'negative'], ['press', 'negative']]
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .####[['phone', 'positive']]
i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .####[['player', 'positive'], ['performs', 'positive'], ['sound', 'negative']]
great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes####[['sound', 'positive'], ['interface', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['software', 'positive'], ['wake-up', 'positive'], ['sleep timers', 'positive']]
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .####[['in-program id3 tag editing', 'positive']]
the sound from the player is ok .####[['sound', 'positive']]
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .####[['combination', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .####[['fm radio tuner', 'positive']]
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .####[['optical zoom', 'positive'], ['14x digital zoom', 'positive']]
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .####[['music', 'positive'], ['menus', 'positive'], ['understand', 'positive']]
another plus in my book , no file limits !####[['file limits', 'positive']]
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .####[['earbuds', 'positive']]
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .####[['features', 'positive'], ['speed', 'positive'], ['picture quality', 'positive'], ['flexibility', 'positive'], ['automation', 'positive'], ['functional conveniences', 'positive']]
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .####[['case', 'negative']]
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .####[['product', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['songs', 'positive']]
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .####[['colors', 'negative'], ['screen', 'negative']]
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .####[['stock tracking app', 'positive'], ['application', 'negative']]
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .####[['software', 'negative']]
what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .####[['software', 'negative']]
this thing plays everything i feed it .####[['plays', 'positive']]
5 . the zen does not have a stop button !####[['stop button', 'negative']]
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !####[['camera', 'positive']]
nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .####[['nokia', 'positive']]
i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .####[['player', 'negative']]
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .####[['clock', 'positive'], ['date', 'positive']]
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .####[['accessories', 'negative']]
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .####[['sound', 'positive'], ['volume', 'positive']]
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .####[['transfer', 'negative']]
the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .####[['player', 'negative'], ['recognizing', 'negative'], ['stopping', 'negative'], ['access', 'negative']]
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! "####[['frame freezes', 'negative'], ['dvd player', 'negative']]
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .####[['picture', 'positive']]
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .####[['nomad', 'negative']]
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .####[['digital camera', 'positive']]
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .####[['function lever', 'negative']]
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]
overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .####[['player', 'positive']]
i have had no problems with the phone .####[['phone', 'positive']]
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .####[['caller-id pictures', 'negative'], ['individualized ringtones', 'negative']]
service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .####[['service', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive'], ['ringtones', 'positive'], ['aim', 'positive']]
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .####[['scroll wheel', 'negative']]
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .####[['mediasource software', 'positive']]
the dvd player just would't recognize them .####[['dvd player', 'negative'], ['recognize', 'negative']]
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !####[['shipping', 'positive']]
owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .####[['manual', 'positive'], ['troubleshooting guide', 'positive']]
ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all####[['play', 'positive']]
we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked .####[['remotes', 'negative'], ['worked', 'negative']]
also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .####[['sound', 'positive'], ['earphones', 'negative']]
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .####[['fm', 'negative'], ['voice recording', 'negative']]
the service from t-mobile is very good too .####[['service from t-mobile', 'positive']]
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .####[['price', 'positive'], ['specs', 'positive'], ['memory mp3 player', 'positive']]
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .####[['machine', 'positive'], ['set up', 'positive']]
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !####[['resolution', 'positive'], ['colors', 'positive']]
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .####[['play', 'negative']]
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .####[['dvd', 'negative'], ['picture', 'negative'], ['freeze', 'negative'], ['plays', 'negative']]
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .####[['read', 'negative'], ['dvds', 'negative']]
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .####[['skipping', 'negative']]
by the way , it looks nice also .####[['looks', 'positive']]
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .####[['no disc', 'negative']]
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .####[['sound', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
i am enjoying my phone a lot ....####[['phone', 'positive']]
it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .####[['firewire', 'negative']]
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;####[['4mp resolution', 'positive']]
unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .####[['g3', 'negative'], ['captures', 'negative']]
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .####[['battery', 'positive']]
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .####[['nomad explorer', 'positive'], ['transfer files', 'positive']]
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .####[['g3', 'positive']]
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !####[['dvd player', 'negative']]
the other controls are all very easy to use .####[['controls', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .####[['4 mp', 'positive'], ['3x optical', 'positive']]
no matter the format .####[['format', 'positive']]
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .####[['accessing files', 'positive']]
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !####[['looks', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .####[['higher pitched rings', 'negative'], ['hear', 'positive'], ['listen', 'negative']]
this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .####[['dvd players', 'positive'], ['play', 'positive']]
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !####[['battery life', 'positive']]
and really this is the best phone one could have .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the radio feature has superb sound quality .####[['radio feature', 'positive'], ['sound quality', 'positive']]
8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).####[['mediasource', 'positive'], ['looking', 'negative'], ['organizing', 'positive'], ['cddb service', 'positive']]
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .####[['case', 'negative']]
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .####[['sounds', 'positive']]
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .####[['runs', 'positive'], ['dvd media', 'positive']]
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery####[['storage capacity', 'positive'], ['navigate', 'positive'], ['playlists', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive']]
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .####[['line out jack', 'negative']]
the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .####[['signal to noise ratio', 'positive']]
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .####[['quality', 'negative']]
if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .####[['tags', 'negative']]
* lens visible in optical viewfinder .####[['viewfinder', 'negative']]
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .####[['camera', 'positive']]
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .####[['voice-activated dialing', 'negative'], ['headset jack', 'negative']]
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .####[['nomad', 'positive'], ['controls', 'positive']]
the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !####[['sound volume', 'positive']]
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )####[['diopter adjustment dial', 'negative'], ['turn', 'negative'], ['adjustment', 'negative']]
feels solid in hand .####[['feels', 'positive']]
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .####[['lock up', 'negative']]
we tried the " finding nemo " dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .####[['dvd', 'negative'], ['freeze', 'negative']]
the moveable lcd screen is great .####[['lcd', 'positive']]
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .####[['napster', 'positive']]
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user-friendly player imo .####[['navigation', 'positive']]
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .####[['deal', 'positive']]
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .####[['player', 'positive']]
great phone , i 'd buy another .####[['phone', 'positive']]
software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .####[['software', 'negative'], ['music match jukebox', 'negative']]
have had the player since xmass and love it !####[['player', 'positive']]
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .####[['mpeg2 format', 'positive'], ['vob files', 'positive']]
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .####[['smell', 'negative']]
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .####[['customer service department', 'negative']]
the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .####[['automode', 'positive'], ['aperture priority', 'positive'], ['shutter priority', 'positive']]
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .####[['video signal', 'negative']]
7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .####[['mediasource', 'negative']]
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####[['customization options', 'positive']]
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .####[['backlit screen', 'positive']]
the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !####[['player', 'negative'], ['no disc', 'negative']]
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !####[['powershot g3', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .####[['sync', 'positive']]
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .####[['battery', 'positive']]
the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .####[['eax support', 'positive']]
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####[['leather case', 'positive']]
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .####[['canon powershot g3', 'positive']]
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .####[['camera', 'positive']]
wo n't play a lot of discs .####[['play', 'negative'], ['discs', 'negative']]
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )####[['plays', 'positive'], ['format', 'positive']]
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .####[['focus range', 'positive'], ['manual focus mode', 'positive']]
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .####[['quality pictures', 'positive'], ['combination', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['flexibility', 'positive']]
1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .####[['size', 'negative'], ['weighs', 'negative']]
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .####[['explorer program', 'negative']]
the software , which comes with player is not good at all .####[['software', 'negative']]
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .####[['dvd', 'negative']]
the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .####[['phone', 'positive']]
it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " .####[['no disc', 'negative']]
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .####[['dvd', 'negative']]
overall an excellent phone .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the screen 's large and easily read .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['read', 'positive']]
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .####[['camera', 'positive']]
software - the software is crap .####[['software', 'negative']]
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .####[['pic', 'positive']]
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .####[['service', 'negative']]
i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .####[['auto fit feature', 'positive']]
overall i like the unit .####[['unit', 'positive']]
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .####[['nikon', 'positive']]
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :####[['battery', 'positive']]
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .####[['nokia 6610', 'positive']]
other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .####[['battery', 'positive'], ['presets', 'positive'], ['construction', 'positive']]
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####[['default ringtones', 'negative']]
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .####[['calls', 'negative']]
i can only hear the sound but no picture !####[['picture', 'negative']]
great quality picture and features .####[['quality picture', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .####[['battery', 'positive']]
navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .####[['navigation system', 'negative']]
the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .####[['earbuds', 'positive']]
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .####[['headphone jack', 'negative']]
2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "####[['id3 tags', 'negative']]
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .####[['folder name', 'negative']]
i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .####[['work', 'negative']]
on my main computer the software did not work right .####[['software', 'negative']]
i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .####[['better', 'negative']]
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .####[['player', 'positive']]
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .####[['bluetooth', 'negative']]
the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .####[['back-up device', 'positive']]
the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .####[['eax sound enhancement feature', 'negative'], ['custom eq', 'negative']]
overall it is the best camera on the market .####[['camera', 'positive']]
good quality video .####[['quality video', 'positive']]
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .####[['optics', 'positive'], ['processing algorithms', 'positive']]
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .####[['scroll', 'positive']]
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .####[['navigation', 'positive'], ['scrolling', 'negative'], ['searching', 'negative']]
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^####[['screen saver feature', 'positive']]
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .####[['appearance', 'positive']]
pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?####[['pc cable', 'negative']]
it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).####[['battery life', 'positive']]
interface - practically seamless .####[['interface', 'positive']]
* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .####[['case', 'negative']]
creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .####[['eax', 'negative']]
this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['warranty', 'negative']]
- solid , high-quality construction####[['construction', 'positive']]
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .####[['3x optical setting', 'positive']]
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####[['looks', 'positive']]
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .####[['wheel', 'negative']]
this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .####[['player', 'positive'], ['video output', 'negative']]
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .####[['t-mobile', 'negative']]
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .####[['macro', 'positive']]
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.####[['nomad explorer', 'positive'], ['alter', 'positive'], ['sort', 'positive']]
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :####[['hot shoe flash attachment', 'positive']]
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .####[['apex', 'positive']]
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .####[['player', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['understand features', 'positive'], ['software', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive']]
the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .####[['read', 'negative'], ['dvd disc', 'negative']]
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .####[['price', 'positive'], ['works', 'positive']]
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .####[['discs', 'negative'], ['recognize', 'negative']]
the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .####[['play', 'negative']]
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).####[['volume', 'negative']]
even viewed cds full of jpgs .####[['jpgs', 'positive']]
player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .####[['dual-layer dvd', 'negative']]
the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .####[['ad-1600', 'negative'], ['ad-1220', 'negative']]
this is the best phone i have seen .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .####[['use', 'positive']]
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .####[['auto mode', 'positive'], ['to', 'positive']]
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .####[['quality construction', 'negative']]
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .####[['install software', 'positive']]
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the general button placement is not very user-friendly .####[['button placement', 'negative']]
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .####[['auto-mode', 'positive'], ['a manual', 'positive']]
the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .####[['speakerphone', 'positive']]
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .####[['loud speaker function', 'positive']]
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .####[['looking apex dvd player', 'positive']]
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .####[['software', 'positive'], ['online service', 'positive'], ['focused', 'positive']]
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .####[['phone', 'positive']]
i 've had no problems with the software .####[['software', 'positive']]
* price and capacity####[['price', 'positive'], ['capacity', 'positive']]
